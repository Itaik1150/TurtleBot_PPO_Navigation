# TurtleBot PPO Navigation 🤖

Hey Nir!  
Feel free to clone this repo and explore 🚀

To run the simulation world (with the robot and the maze), use the launch file:

📄 `maze_world.launch`  
(located in `src/my_turtlebot_ppo_project/launch/`)

Core logic is handled in:

- `src/my_turtlebot_ppo_project/train_ppo.py`
- `src/my_turtlebot_ppo_project/env/turtlebot3_env.py`

Thanks a lot for your help! 🙏
